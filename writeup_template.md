**Finding Lane Lines on the Road**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Make a pipeline that finds lane lines on the road
* Reflect on your work in a written report

### Reflection

###1. Describe your pipeline. As part of the description, explain how you modified the draw_lines() function.

My pipeline consisted of 5 steps. First, I converted the images to grayscale, then I apply a gaussian blur so the edges of the image get smoother. 
After that, I apply a canny edge detector, where the values are out of Canny recommendations but of this way I was able to detect edges even in the challenge.
Once I detect the edges, I created a ROI based on the proportions of the image, of this way I didn't have to change the values for the challenge. I experimented with the values until I found a satisfying value.

The last step was to use the algorithm of Hough lines to create lines with the edge detection.

To render the straight lines I decided to use a regression of the points in the image:
First, I separated the lines that returns the method hough_linesP based on their slope and position so I can create two separated lines. Then I took the points of each group of lines and applied a regression method to create an unique line for each side that would represent each line.

###2. Identify potential shortcomings with your current pipeline


One potential shortcoming would be what would happen when there is noise in the image due to bad state of the road or shadows. You can see an example in this frame of the challenge:
In blue appear the lines detected by the Hough algorithm and green and red the lines generated by the regression method.

Due to marks in the road the algorithm its confused with wrong data.

###3. Suggest possible improvements to your pipeline

With a better treatment of the image at the begining it would be possible to achieve better results in the challenge. I experimented with the exposition, gamma and contrast of the image and the results of the lane detection improved.

An easing between frames because my pipeline just print the lines based on the date of the frame but it will be better to apply some control based on previous data.

Another potential improvement could be to ...
